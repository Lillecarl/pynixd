"""Background liveness tracking: what Nix calls alive, without asking Nix per pass.

**SPIKE STATUS: measurement only.** Nothing plans from this yet; the
collector still asks Nix. What this builds is the evidence that it could
stop: a roots table plus one closure query that Nix agrees with. Cutover is
a later commit, after the differential test holds zero divergence
sustained -- and no delete runs anywhere until then.

Why this shape: both of Nix's query actions run the same mark phase
(`gc.cc` answers `gcReturnDead` and `gcReturnLive` from one `alive` set),
so asking differently saves nothing, and per-root closures recompute the
shared subgraphs thousands of times. One multi-source closure over the
whole graph visits each node once: measured 1.1 s on 187k paths against
6+ minutes for the trace. The query reads Nix's own tables next to
pynixd's two, so the only Python logic is enumerating root links -- the
closure itself stays in SQL, where there is nothing to diverge.

Two tables, two refresh policies. Stable roots (`gcroots`, `profiles`)
change with deployments: diffed against the table, recompute only on
change. Volatile roots (`/proc`, `temproots`) change constantly and never
land in the table at all; they join each closure query as a parameter.
Typical pass cost is the walks plus three cheap queries (roots diff,
fingerprint, skip check); the closure runs only when something moved.

What it deliberately does not mirror: unlinking stale `gcroots/auto`
links (Nix owns that mutation; the mirror only skips them), and censoring
(a tracker has no untrusted reader).
