"""Who may connect to the store, and who is trusted.

A port of `authPeer` and `matchUser` in `src/nix/unix/daemon.cc:178-257` of
Nix 2.34.8. pynixd applies Nix's rules itself, rather than connecting to
nix-daemon as the client, so that it can grow its own per-user policy later.
Issue #56 holds the decision and the churn of these rules across releases.
