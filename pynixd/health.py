"""What "healthy" means for pynixd, and the loop measurement behind it.

Two things a probe has to tell apart, and a TCP accept on the data port tells
neither (nixkube#37, #53):

- **Wedged.** The kernel completes `connect()` from the listen backlog whether
  or not the application ever accepts, so a TCP probe passes against a process
  that has stopped serving entirely.
- **Busy.** A transfer that does not yield stalls the loop, and a stalled loop
  answers nothing. The probe then fails against a process that is working
  correctly, and the restart destroys the evidence.

So health here is two questions. Is the loop running callbacks, and is every
interface the configuration asked for actually serving? Neither is answerable
from outside the process.

`EVENT_LOOP_LAG` is exported whether or not it is over the threshold, because
the useful form of this number is a graph that rises before anything restarts.

    and the liveness probe then restarted the container. Nothing recorded what
    it was doing, and a benchmark has never produced it.

    So the diagnosis has to come from the process it happens in. The loop
    writes a timestamp every lag sample; this thread watches that timestamp
    and dumps stacks when it goes stale.

    **A thread, because the loop cannot report on itself.** Anything scheduled
    on the loop runs after the stall, where the stack no longer shows what
