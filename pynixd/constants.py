# Here rather than in `health.py` so `config.py` can name it without importing
# health, which would pull `prometheus_client` into the import path of
# anything that reads configuration. Issue #30 measured what an eager import
# costs every daemon start.

# **Prefer AES-GCM, because almost every box pynixd runs on has AES-NI.**
# asyncssh offers chacha20-poly1305 first, which is the right default for a
# library that cannot know its host and the wrong one here. Measured on a host
# with `aes` and `vaes`, one MiB through asyncssh's own cipher objects:
#
#     chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com   3678 MiB/s   0.27 ms/MiB
#     aes256-gcm@openssh.com          9041 MiB/s   0.11 ms/MiB
#     aes128-gcm@openssh.com         10806 MiB/s   0.09 ms/MiB
#
# That is 2.46x on the cipher, and it is event loop CPU on every byte.
#
# **It does not show end to end, and the reason is worth keeping.** Eight
# concurrent clients moving 128 MiB measured 185-193 MiB/s pushing under
# chacha20 and 165-177 under AES-GCM -- within noise, and if anything worse.
# Crypto is about 0.27 ms/MiB against roughly 7 ms/MiB for the Python that
# forwards the bytes, so it is ~4% of the cost and cannot move the total. The
# saving is real loop CPU (~0.16 ms/MiB, about 460 ms over a 2.8 GiB closure)
# and nothing more. Do not quote the 2.46x as a transfer speedup.
#
# **This only binds where pynixd is the SSH client.** The chosen cipher is the
# first entry of the *client's* list that the server also offers (RFC 4253
# 7.1), and OpenSSH leads with chacha20-poly1305. So a `nix copy` into pynixd
# keeps chacha20 whatever the server offers; changing that needs
# `NIX_SSHOPTS="-c aes256-gcm@openssh.com"` on the pushing side.
#
# **The `^` prefix makes this a preference and not a whitelist.** asyncssh
# reads it as "these first, then the defaults" (`connection._expand_algs`), so
# chacha20 stays available. That matters: a host without AES-NI does software
# AES far slower than chacha20, and pinning AES would punish exactly the hosts
# the default was protecting.
