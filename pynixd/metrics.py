"""Prometheus metrics for pynixd, served from the `/metrics` route.

**Every label here is bounded.** A store path, a client address or a
derivation name would give one series per value, and a cache that serves a
cluster sees millions of them. `op` comes from `WIRE_REGISTRY`, `store_id`
from the configuration, and `result`, `route` and `transport` are written out
in this file.

`prometheus_client` registers `ProcessCollector`, `PlatformCollector` and
`GCCollector` on the default registry by itself, so `process_cpu_seconds_total`,
`process_resident_memory_bytes`, `process_open_fds` and `python_gc_*` are
already served. Do not add a gauge for any of them.

    the scrape is both cheaper and fresher than a periodic write.

    measured on this machine, `sum(narSize)` over `ValidPaths` answers 952 GB

    and the hard links that the store on disk has, so that sum answers a
    question nobody asked.

    It is also too slow to serve. `select count(*), sum(narSize)` took 584 ms

    `appstarter init` fetches the environment the deployment names, and when
    that fetch fails it seeds the store from the copy baked into the image
    instead. That is deliberate -- a pod that starts behind beats a pod that
    does not start -- and it is invisible from outside: the pod is Running and
    every probe passes either way. The two store paths in `state.json` are the
    only thing that says which happened.

    **Read from the file and on the scrape, not from the environment at
    import.** `appstarter run` puts both paths in the environment of the
    container it execs, and only some of these containers are started that way
    -- the builder runs its program directly. The store they share answers for
    all of them.

    **Absent rather than zero when the file cannot be read.** A process that
    cannot tell must not report "not degraded", which is the one answer that
    would hide exactly what this exists to show. Alert on `== 1`, and on
    `absent()` separately if the silence itself matters.

    **1 is a state, not an event: it cannot clear while the pod lives.**
    `appstarter init` is an `initContainer`, and a container restart does not
    re-run one -- a pod killed by its liveness probe comes back onto the same
    store and reports the same bit. Only a new pod, or a sandbox the kubelet
    recreates after a node restart, decides it again. So an alert on `== 1`
    needs no `for:` beyond a scrape or two, will not flap, and stays firing
    until somebody replaces the pod.

    The paths are deliberately not labels: this module's rule against store
    paths holds, the bit is what an alert needs, and the paths are in the
    pod's log and in `APPSTARTER_RUNNING_STORE_PATH`.

    The store root is the parent of the *real* store directory, so a chroot
    store finds its own state file rather than the host's.
