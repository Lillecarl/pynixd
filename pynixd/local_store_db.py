"""Direct SQLite access to the local Nix store database.

Provides a connection pool for direct SQL queries against the local store DB.
Operations that support fast-path SQL queries use ``store.db.acquire_conn()``
directly rather than going through a dispatcher.

Reference updates are batched writes into pynixd's own access table:
heads only, never closures. Marking one path used to touch its whole
transitive closure -- tens of thousands of rows in one write transaction
against the daemon's own database, every few seconds -- for paths nobody
observed. A row now means exactly "named in traffic"; anything untouched
resolves its age from `registrationTime` instead. Nix's own tables are
never written: not even `registrationTime`, which Nix writes once at
registration and `nix path-info` reports as the entry age.

If the database can't be opened (permissions, missing file, wrong schema),
logs a warning and becomes unavailable — callers fall back to the daemon.

pynixd also keeps tables of its own in this file. `db_migrations` owns their
schema and their version, and `open` migrates them. The two answers are
separate: `active` says that Nix's tables are readable, and `schema.usable`
says that pynixd's tables are at the version this pynixd knows. A store can
give the first and refuse the second, and then every fast path that reads
`ValidPaths` still works.

    **The point is to keep a `SELECT` off a thread hop.** A read through the

    and wakes the event loop when it answers. Measured on this machine, that
    hop is 59 us for one `SELECT 1 FROM ValidPaths WHERE path = ?`, while the
    same query on a synchronous connection is 3.2 us (18x). A build sends one
    `IsValidPath` for every derivation of its closure, so the hop is the cost
    that the fast path was meant to remove.

    **It belongs to a session, not to the store.** A build is a burst of
    reads, and SQLite serialises statements on one connection, so a shared
    connection would let one client's slow query wait behind another's. One
    connection for each client keeps that wait out of the other sessions, and
    it is what makes running the query on the event loop safe in the first
    place: the only work it can block is the client that asked for it.

    The connection is read-only, and it reads a store database that holds a
    rollback journal or a WAL. In WAL a reader never blocks the writer; in a
    rollback journal a running `SELECT` takes a shared lock that a writer
    waits behind. A single statement over an indexed `path` is short, and the
    write path of `pynixd` is on the same event loop, so the lock is held for

    Returns `None` rather than raising. `LocalStoreDB.open` is what decides
    whether the SQLite fast paths are available, and `use_db` defaults to
    true, so a store pynixd cannot read has to degrade and not stop the
    daemon.

    This used to `mkdir(parents=True)` the database directory whenever the
    file was missing, and let the `OSError` out. Two things went wrong with
    that. A store root pynixd may not write -- a read-only file system, or a
    store owned by another user -- raised straight out of `open` and took the
    daemon's startup with it. And a path that holds no Nix store at all got
    `nix/var/nix/db/` created inside it by a function named "resolve".

    The directory is still created, because a managed daemon writes its
    database there and `LocalDBStore.start` calls `ensure_daemon` first, so
    the usual case is a directory that already exists. A failure to create it
    now means the fast paths are off, and nothing more.
