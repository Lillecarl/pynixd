"""`hashDerivationModulo` over the closure of a derivation.

`Derivation.hash_derivation_modulo` hashes one derivation. It needs the hash
of each output that the derivation reads from another derivation, so this
walks the input derivations and collects those hashes.

`hashDerivationModulo` at `derivations.cc:891` of Nix gives two rules, and
each one is easy to get wrong:

- **The walk does not mask the output paths, and the top of the walk does.**
  `pathDerivationModulo` calls `hashDerivationModulo(..., false)`, and the
  caller of the outermost derivation passes `true`.
- **The key of an input is the plain hexadecimal hash of that output.** Nix
  does not hash it a second time.

Measured against the 235 input-addressed derivations of one machine: the path
that `makeOutputPath` builds from each hash is the path that the derivation
itself states.

The hash names a derivation output on the wire, as `sha256:<hex>!<name>`.
Issue #179 gives the answer that needs it.
