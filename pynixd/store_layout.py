"""Where a local store keeps its paths and its state.

**Nix has two ways to put a store somewhere other than `/nix/store`, and they
are not the same way.** pynixd served one of them until issue #176.

- **A chroot store.** `--store <root>` puts the files at `<root>/nix/store`
  and the state at `<root>/nix/var/nix`. It moves no store path:
  `builtins.storeDir` still answers `/nix/store`, and so does the text in
  front of the hash of every path on the wire. Measured against Nix 2.34.8.
- **A relocated store.** `NIX_STORE_DIR` moves the store path itself, so the
  logical directory and the directory on disk are one. `NIX_STATE_DIR` moves
  the state, and the two are independent in Nix.

`StoreLayout` holds the three directories that follow from the choice, and it
is the one place that answers them. Four readers had the layout written into
them before: `ensure_daemon` built the argument of the daemon, `_adopt_store_dir`
set the real directory, `resolve_db_path` built the path of `db.sqlite`, and
`temp_roots.state_dir` built the path of `temproots`. A relocated store breaks
each one, and each one broke in its own way.

`nix_daemon_protocol.store_dir` keeps the process-wide values that a codec
reads. This module decides what to put in them, and it also answers the state
directory, which no codec needs.
