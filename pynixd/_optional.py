"""The four servers that a configuration may never start.

Each one loads `asyncssh` or `aiohttp`, and `Server.start` runs it only when
its port or its `enabled` flag is set. A daemon that serves a Unix socket
starts none of them, and it used to load all four anyway: 232 modules and
0.28 s of every start. Issue #290 holds the measurement.

**Read the module through this one, and not with an import.** `instance.py`
does `from . import _optional` at the top, and
`_optional.ssh_server.start_ssh_server(...)` inside `Server.start`. That is an
attribute read on a module object, so `__getattr__` below runs and imports the
module at the moment the configuration asks for it.

The table is written twice, once for the interpreter and once for pyright.
`tests/unit/test_import_budget.py` compares the two.
