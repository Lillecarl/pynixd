"""Readiness for systemd's `Type=notify`: one datagram, and no dependency.

`Type=simple` calls the unit active when the process starts. pynixd binds
its listeners about two seconds later, and in `replace` mode the daemon
socket is one of them, so a unit ordered after pynixd found no daemon.
Measured in the daemon guest session: active at 8.0s, first log line at
9.8s, and `prepare` saw no listener on the socket.
