"""The order in which the root goals of one request may enqueue a build.

**Nix has no race here, and the reason is how its worker steps a goal.**
`Worker::run` at `worker.cc:352` takes a snapshot of `awake`, which is a
`std::set` over `CompareGoalPtrs`, and then calls `goal->work()` on each
member in that order. A store query inside a goal of Nix is an ordinary
blocking call, so one `work()` call carries the goal from its start to
`waitForBuildSlot`. Stepping the goals in the order of the key and asking
for a build slot in the order of the key are therefore the same thing.

pynixd runs its root goals as coroutines that suspend on real I/O, so the
four goals of one request reach "I want a build" in the order that the event
loop gives them. `main:build` measured 26 ms between the first and the last,
and the one slot of `-j1` went to whichever goal arrived first.

**This orders the moment a goal enqueues, and it does not order the
preparation.** Every goal still reads its derivation and asks the store at
the same time as its siblings. A goal may enqueue its build when every goal
before it in the order has decided, and a goal decides when it enqueues a
build or when it ends without one.

Two properties follow, and both are the reason for this shape:

- **The first goal never waits.** It has nothing before it, so it enqueues as
  soon as it is ready and takes the slot. That is the goal Nix would take.
- **The idle time is the time that Nix is idle as well.** Nix does not step
  the second goal until the step of the first one returns, so it waits for
  the same preparation.

**This orders the roots that are ready to build, and not every root.** A goal
gives its place up before it waits for a goal that can reach another root of
the same request, and `EnsureDerivedPathGoal.run_child` holds that rule. The
two would wait for each other without it: a derivation early in the order can
depend on a derivation late in it, so the early goal waits for the late one to
finish while the late one waits for the early one to decide. A root that waits
for its input derivations therefore reaches the queue in no fixed order against
its siblings. Nix keeps the order across such a wait, because `Worker::awake` is
a set over the key and it sorts the goals again each time it wakes them. The
difference reaches a request whose roots each have an input to build, and it
reaches no test of the suite: the four derivations of `fod-failing.nix` that
`build.sh:167` measures have no input derivation.

**The measurement.** `main - nix-functional-tests:build`, 10 runs before and 20
runs after, against Nix 2.34. Before: 7 runs failed. After: 0 runs failed.
