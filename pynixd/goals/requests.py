    """The result of *goal*, or `None` when *stop* comes first.

    **A goal that the request left behind reports nothing, and it keeps
    running.** Nix takes both halves of that. `Worker::run` leaves its loop
    when `topGoals` is empty, so a goal that is still building never reaches
    `amDone`, its `exitCode` stays `ecBusy`, and
    `Worker::buildPathsWithResults` at `entry-points.cc:93` skips it. Nix then
    destroys the goal, which kills the builder as well.

    pynixd keeps the build. A build of pynixd serves every client that asked
    for the same derivation, and one client that gave up must not take the
    work of the others. So this stops waiting and leaves the build alone.

    NIX-DEVIATION (#206): `Worker::run` at `worker.cc:352` leaves its loop
    when `topGoals` is empty, and the destructor of the goals that are left
    kills each builder. pynixd keeps every such build and ends it in
    `BuildQueue.let_go`, when the **last** goal system stops waiting for it.
    The difference is worth its cost because a build here is shared: a second
    client that asked for the same derivation still wants it, and killing it
    for the first client takes the work of the second. The cost is the builds
    that nobody wants and that pynixd runs anyway, and today that cost is
    zero. Measure it to reverse the decision.
    `nix build -f fod-failing.nix -j1 -L` writes one `building '...'` line
    through pynixd and one through `nix-daemon`, measured on Nix 2.34.8.

    It wrote three until issue #287 and issue #286, and the two answered
    different halves. #287: the request took 2.05 s to act on the failure of
    x1, because a failed build waited a 2 s deadline for an output it could
    not have. #286: even at 2.3 ms the freed slot of `-j1` still went out
    first, in the same pass as the completion, so `Scheduler._assign_to_stores`
    now asks `BuildQueue.nobody_wants` before it assigns. That reads a fact
    rather than winning a race, so the count above does not rest on timing.

    `main:build` measured what the waiting costs. `nix flake check
    ./cancelled-builds -j2` builds `fast-fail` and `slow` together, and
    `slow` blocks on a fifo. Nix answers as soon as `fast-fail` fails and
    says nothing about `slow`; `build.sh:245` asserts that no `error:` line
    names it. pynixd waited for `slow` and then reported it, and with a fifo
    that nothing opens the wait has no end.

    `asyncio.shield` is the one primitive that does this. `Goal.result`
    awaits the `asyncio.Task` of the goal, and a cancellation of the awaiting
    task cancels that task as well, because `Task.__step` cancels the future
    it waits on. `shield` puts a second future between the two, and a
    cancellation reaches that one alone. It also reads the outcome of the
    goal when nothing else does, so an abandoned failure raises no "exception
    was never retrieved" report. anyio offers no equivalent, and the goal
    system is asyncio below `Goal.result`. Issue #196.
