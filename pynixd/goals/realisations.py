"""The output path that a realisation names, and not the derivation.

`Store::queryPartialDerivationOutputMap` answers the path of each output of a
derivation. For an input-addressed output the derivation names that path. For
a deferred, floating or impure output the derivation names nothing, and the
store answers instead: a realisation maps
`DrvOutput{staticOutputHashes(drv)[name], name}` to the path that the build
made.

**A derivation that names no output path is not therefore unbuilt.** Two goals
of pynixd read the derivation alone and drew that conclusion, and each one was
wrong in its own way:

- `EnsureDerivedPathGoal` built the derivation again. Issue #185.
- `QueryMissingPlanGoal` answered `willBuild`, and `nix-daemon` answers an
  empty set, because `misc.cc:217` reads the same map and finds every output
  valid.

Issue #175.
