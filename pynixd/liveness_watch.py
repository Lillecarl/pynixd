"""Wake promptly when the stable roots move.

`StableRootsWatch` watches the state dir through watchdog -- inotify on
Linux, FSEvents on macOS, picked per platform -- and sets a dirty event
on anything that may have moved the roots. The observer lives on its own
thread and pumps a plain queue; the async side blocks in `queue.get`
inside `to_thread` and sets the flag, so no anyio object ever crosses a
thread. The periodic check re-walks everything as usual, so this buys
latency, not correctness: a deployment retargets a link and the mirror
recomputes in milliseconds instead of at the next interval, and a quiet
tree costs no walks at all. A missed event degrades to polling, never to
a stale mirror, because the anchor check still walks the whole trees.

What wakes the check, and why each is safe:

- create/delete/move under either tree: every entry there is a root or
  a directory of roots. The watch is recursive, so a new subdirectory is
  covered from birth; the check re-walks the whole tree anyway.
- the state dir itself: only a tree appearing or leaving counts, so the
  churn under `temproots/` never wakes anyone. This closes the startup
  gap where a tree does not exist yet.

What never wakes it: symlinked directories are not descended into, the
way neither Nix (`findRoots` reads `symlink_status`, `gc.cc:250`) nor
the walk does -- watchdog follows the same rule with `recursive=True`,
which does not cross links -- and `/proc` cannot be watched at all, so
the volatile roots stay polled like before. File content changes carry
no signal either: roots move by replacement, never by rewrite.
