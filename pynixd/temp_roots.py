"""The temporary roots of the collector, written by pynixd itself.

A temporary root keeps a store path alive while a client still needs it, and
it goes away when that client does. Nix writes one file for each process, at
`<state>/temproots/<pid>`, and the process holds a write lock on that file
for as long as the roots must live. Each root is one store path and one NUL
byte, appended to the file.

`LocalStore::findTempRoots` reads that directory. A file it can write-lock
belongs to a process that is gone, so the collector deletes the file. A file
it cannot write-lock gives it one root for each path inside. The name of the
file means nothing to the collector, which uses the name for a log line only,
so pynixd is free to write one file for each client session.

**pynixd forwarded `AddTempRoot` to the upstream daemon, and that is the
defect of issue #20.** The root then belonged to the upstream connection,
and pynixd pools those connections between clients. So the root of a client
outlived that client, and a discarded connection dropped the root of a client
that still ran. A root that pynixd writes itself needs no connection at all,
and its life is exactly the life of the client session.

Nix implements the same three steps in `LocalStore::addTempRoot`, in
`src/libstore/gc.cc`, and this module follows that function. The lock is
`flock(2)`, from `src/libstore/unix/pathlocks.cc`.

    One instance belongs to one client session. `close` releases every root

    no operation in the daemon protocol that removes a temporary root, so the
    only way to release one is to let go of the file.

    pynixd degrades to nothing when it cannot write the directory, which
    happens when it serves the system store as an unprivileged user. The
    client then gets the same answer that a non-admin client got before: the
    operation reports success and adds no root. A collector that runs at that
