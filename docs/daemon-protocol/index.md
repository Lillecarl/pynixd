# Daemon Protocol Implementation

The reusable `nix_daemon_protocol` package implements the [Nix daemon wire protocol][nix-protocol] using a Pydantic-based serialization framework. Every protocol message (request and response) is a Pydantic model that auto-generates its own binary encoder and decoder from Python type annotations. `pynixd` consumes this package for daemon transport and execution.

## Supported protocol versions

The codec package supports the contiguous **1.32 through 1.38** interval. Fast
in-memory compatibility tests run every protocol boundary in that interval.
Expensive real-daemon tests remain anchored at 1.32 (nixbuild.net), 1.35
(Lix), and the current Nix protocol. Requests also declare their introduction
version and reject attempts to send an operation to an older negotiated daemon.

## Deserialization diagnostics

The protocol package reports malformed wire data through an optional logging
adapter. It uses structlog when the embedding environment has it installed and
falls back to the standard-library `nix_daemon_protocol` logger otherwise. The
package never configures either logging system. Consumers can also provide a
logger in `ReadContext`.

Recursive decode failures produce one `daemon_deserialization_failed` event at
the outermost message boundary, then re-raise the original exception. Events
contain message type, protocol version, operation (when known), reader ID, and
exception type; they never include raw wire payload data.

## How it works

You write a normal Pydantic model:

```python
class IsValidPathResponse(WireResponse):
    """IsValidPath response — valid bool as uint64 on wire."""

    valid: bool
```

And it automatically knows how to:
- Write `valid` as a `uint64` (0 or 1) on the wire
- Read a `uint64` back from the wire into a `bool`
- Render a human-readable `__init__` signature for IDE autocompletion
- Serialize to/from JSON for debugging

No manual `read_uint64` / `write_uint64` calls. Types are inferred from annotations.

## Base classes

### `WireModel` — the engine

`WireModel` is an abstract base class inheriting from Pydantic's `BaseModel`. It introspects the model's type annotations and synthesizes two methods:

| Method | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `to_writer(ctx)` | Iterates fields in declaration order, writing each to the wire |
| `from_reader(ctx)` | Classmethod — reads fields from the wire in declaration order |

Class variables (`ClassVar[T]`) are **skipped** by default — they hold protocol constants (like op codes) that are handled by the transport layer, not the message body.

Nested `WireModel` fields are serialized **inline** — the child's fields are written directly into the parent's wire stream with no length prefix. This matches the Nix daemon's flat wire format.

### `WireString` — single string on the wire

Some types are represented as a **single length-prefixed UTF-8 string** on the wire — `StorePath` (`"/nix/store/hash-name"`), `Signature` (`"name:base64sig"`), `DerivedPath` (`"drv!out"`), etc. These inherit from `WireString`, which overrides `to_writer`/`from_reader` to read/write the whole object as one string.

Multi-field `WireString` subclasses (like `Signature` and `DrvOutput`) override `from_str`/`to_str` to parse/format with delimiters.

### `WireRequest` / `WireResponse` — operation envelopes

`WireRequest` adds:
- An **op code** (`uint64`) written before the message body
- Auto-registration in `WIRE_REGISTRY` (op code → request class)
- ClassVars for `response_type` and the operation code. The base model also
  carries neutral capability metadata used by consumers; daemon dispatch policy
  belongs to consumers such as `pynixd`, not the reusable codec package.

`WireResponse` adds:
- A `logs: WireLogs` field — the daemon's stderr stream, written/read before body fields

Here's a complete operation pair:

```python
class BuildDerivationRequest(WireRequest):
    op: ClassVar[int] = 36
    response_type = BuildDerivationResponse
    forward: ClassVar[bool] = False  # never forwarded — handled by pynixd

    drv_path: StorePath
    derivation: BasicDerivation
    build_mode: int


class BuildDerivationResponse(WireResponse):
    result: BuildResult
```

## Wire type dispatch

The serialization engine maps Python types to wire primitives:

| Python type | Wire format |
|---|---|
| `int` | `uint64` |
| `IntEnum` | `uint64` (value) |
| `str` | length-prefixed UTF-8 |
| `bool` | `uint64` (0 or 1) |
| `bytes` | length-prefixed bytes |
| `list[T]` | `uint64` count, then N elements |
| `set[T]` | `uint64` count, then N elements |
| `dict[K, V]` | `uint64` count, then N key-value pairs |
| `Optional[T]` | same as `T` (absent/none is context-dependent) |
| `WireString` subclass | single length-prefixed string |
| `WireModel` subclass | inline field-by-field |

Special case: `Optional[StorePath]` writes `""` for `None` — this is Nix's convention for an absent deriver field.

## Version constraints

The Nix daemon protocol evolved across versions. Some fields only exist on the wire at certain protocol versions. `WireField` supports this via `min_version` and `max_version`:

```python
times_built: int | None = WireField(default=None, min_version=proto(1, 29))
cpu_user: OptMicroseconds = WireField(default_factory=OptMicroseconds, min_version=proto(1, 37))
```

Fields outside the negotiated version range are skipped during both serialization and deserialization.

## Conditional fields

Some fields depend on the **value of another field** at runtime — they only appear on the wire under certain conditions. `WireField` supports this via `wire_depends_on`, a predicate that receives `self`:

```python
info: UnkeyedValidPathInfo | None = WireField(
    default=None,
    wire_depends_on=lambda self: self.valid,
)
```

During deserialization, `valid` is read first. If it's `False`, `info` is skipped — the field stays at its default `None`.

## Custom serialization

Some types override `from_reader`/`to_writer` entirely, bypassing field-by-field serialization:

| Type | Reason | Wire format |
|---|---|---|
| `Realisation` | JSON-encoded on wire | length-prefixed UTF-8 containing JSON |
| `Time` / `TimeSpan` | Single `uint64` — faster | raw `uint64` |
| `WireLogs` | Tagged-union stream | `[uint64 code][body]...[STDERR_LAST]` |

## Stderr stream

Every response carries a **stderr stream** (`WireLogs`) — a sequence of tagged-union messages:

```
[uint64 STDERR_NEXT][length-prefixed string]
[uint64 STDERR_START_ACTIVITY][activity fields...]
[uint64 STDERR_STOP_ACTIVITY][activity id]
[uint64 STDERR_RESULT][result fields...]
[uint64 STDERR_ERROR][error fields...]    ← terminates the stream, no STDERR_LAST after
[uint64 STDERR_LAST]                       ← normal end of stream
```

`WireLogs.from_reader` reads messages until it hits `STDERR_LAST` or a `LogError`. `WireLogs.to_writer` writes each message followed by `STDERR_LAST`.
