# pynixd Glossary

This document defines technical terms and concepts used within the `pynixd` codebase.

> **Note**: This glossary is a living document. It is not exhaustive and SHOULD be expanded as new concepts are discovered, clarified, or added to the system.

## Foundational Nix Concepts

### Expression
The high-level code written in the Nix language (typically in `.nix` files). Expressions are evaluated to produce Derivations.

### Derivation (.drv)
A low-level build recipe. It is a static representation of a build task, containing paths to all required inputs (sources and other derivations), the builder script, and the intended output names.

### StorePath
A unique, immutable path within the Nix store (e.g., `/nix/store/z12...-hello-2.12`). The hash in the path is derived from the inputs used to produce the item.

### NAR (Nix Archive)
The serialization format Nix uses to represent a file system object (file, directory, or symlink) as a single byte stream. It is used for transferring paths between stores.

### Hash
Nix primarily uses SHA-256 hashes to identify store paths and ensure the integrity of the store's contents.

## pynixd Core Concepts

### Store
A polymorphic representation of a Nix store. `pynixd` can interact with local stores, remote SSH stores, S3 buckets, etc., using a unified interface.

### DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)
The dependency graph of derivations. `pynixd`'s scheduler is "DAG-aware," meaning it understands the order in which builds must execute based on their dependencies.

### Content-Addressed (CA) Derivation
A derivation where the output path is determined by the hash of the *actual produced content* rather than the derivation's inputs. This allows for "early cutoff" optimizations.

### Realisation
The concrete mapping between a derivation output and its final `StorePath`. For CA derivations, this mapping is only known after the build is complete.

### Deferred Output
An output path that cannot be calculated before the build (common in CA derivations). These are resolved "on the fly" by the `DynamicDerivationResolver`.

### Trampolining
A Nix-native concept for "unknown output" building (common in CA derivations). It is the process where a build is intercepted because it has "deferred" dependencies that must be resolved first. Once resolved (possibly by triggering sub-builds), the original derivation is updated and re-injected into the build process. In `pynixd`:
- **`DerivationResolver`** handles pre-build resolution (deferred output, dynamic DrvWithVersion)
- **`Trampoline`** handles post-build inner-build enqueuing and DAG rewiring

## pynixd Architecture

### Three-Tier Execution
The pattern used to separate protocol IO from logic:
1. **Server Dispatch** (`handle`): Entry point that decodes from the client wire.
2. **Logic Hook** (`execute`): Implements optimizations and core business logic.
3. **Transport** (`call`): Low-level wire protocol implementation for upstream communication.

### Umbrella Repository
A repository that composes related projects while their package ownership and
physical source layout remain independent. For the nanopynix umbrella, this
means composing `nanopynix` and `pynixd` through explicit versioned package or
service boundaries first; it does not imply sibling-relative Python imports or
an immediate source-tree merger.

### Daemon Protocol Package
The reusable `nix_daemon_protocol` Python package. It contains the standard
Nix daemon wire codecs and protocol value models, but no daemon scheduling,
authentication, client forwarding, or pynixd-private operation definitions.
Those runtime concerns remain in `pynixd`; its private wire extensions live in
`pynixd.daemon_extensions`.

### Wire Scalar
An immutable domain value whose complete daemon-protocol representation is one
string. `StorePath`, `NARHash`, `ContentAddress`, and `DerivedPath` are wire
scalars: they subclass `str` to retain native string equality and hashing while
adding Nix-specific helpers. The protocol codec recognizes these values
directly; Pydantic support exists only for model/API boundaries rather than
making the scalar itself a Pydantic model.

### Proxy (`DaemonProxy`)
The component that manages the connection from a Nix client, handles the protocol handshake, and routes requests to the internal logic.

### Tracker (`PathTracker`)
An internal database (SQLite) that tracks which `StorePath`s are available on which `Store`, enabling locality-aware scheduling.

### Ranker / Allocator
*   **Ranker**: Scores available stores based on telemetry (CPU pressure, latency, etc.).
*   **Allocator**: Matches a pending build task to the most appropriate store based on ranks and requirements.

### Store Priority (Float Multiplier)
A per-store multiplier (`priority`, default `1.0`) applied to the telemetry score during ranking. Values > 1.0 make a store more likely to be picked; < 1.0 make it less likely. The `min_schedule_score` threshold is checked against the *raw* score before multiplication, so priority only reorders stores that are already capable. Set in store config:
```nix
{
  type = "ssh-subprocess";
  host = "builder1";
  priority = 2.0;  # preferred
}
```

### Goal System
A request-scoped dependency walker for daemon operations that need to traverse derivations and store paths. `BuildPaths` and `BuildPathsWithResults` use mutating goals that may substitute or build; `QueryMissing` uses a read-only planning goal that may inspect local validity and substitution availability but must not import or build paths.

### GoalRun / GoalEngine
The current implementation creates a fresh `GoalEngine` per daemon request, which acts as the request-local goal run. It deduplicates active goals within that request only. Completed goal results are not cached globally; later requests discover current truth from the local store, substitution caches, and scheduler queues.

### Mutating Ensure Goal
`EnsureDerivedPathGoal` is the mutating coordinator for making a `DerivedPath` available locally. It may substitute paths, schedule builds through the global scheduler, resolve deferred outputs, and walk nested dynamic derivation chains.

### Read-Only Planning Goal
`QueryMissingPlanGoal` is the read-only counterpart used by `QueryMissing`. It classifies requested paths into `will_build`, `will_substitute`, and `unknown` without changing the local store. It may refresh substitution availability caches because those are scheduler-side query metadata, not local store realisation.

### Scheduler Work Lane
A typed side-effect lane owned by the singleton scheduler. Build work lives in the build lane (`BuildQueue`, builder assignment, subscribers, and `.drv` deduplication). Substitution work lives in the substitution lane (`SubstitutionQueue`, availability caches, health logs, background probes, and import deduplication).

### SubstitutionQueue
The scheduler-owned substitution lane. It exposes `can_substitute(path)` for fast availability checks, `get_substituter(path)` for selecting the highest-priority healthy source, and `substitute(path)` for deduplicated path imports into the local store.

### Client-Bound Build Subscription
A build log subscription tied to an active client request. Client-bound subscriptions are reference-counted per build. If the last such subscriber is explicitly removed before completion, the queued build is cancelled; internal no-client scheduler users are not cancelled by this rule.
