    The interpreter of the development shell, resolved by pyproject.nix.

    **One set, and not a path of several.**  `nanopynix-testing` is the
    oracle of `tests/differential`, and `nanopynix/settings.py:15` imports
    `nanopynix_bindings`, so a PYTHONPATH assembled from store paths imports
    the packages and then fails on the first attribute.  Only a set that
    resolves the whole closure works, and mixing a package built in one set
    into another set's environment does not resolve either.

    `pythonSetWith` and not `pythonSet.overrideScope`: a set lifts its
    nixpkgs packages once, from the roots it was seeded with, so a project
    this repository owns has no way in afterwards.  `projectRoots` reads each
    `pyproject.toml` beside ours and resolves its dependencies the same way.
    nanopynix documents this as the seam for a consumer, and easykubenix uses
    it for `ekn`.

    Every root here is a real pyproject project, which is why this works at
    all: `uml-runner` carries one at `pkgs/uml-runner`, and it is what
    the phase scripts in `tests/guest/` import.

    **pynixd itself does not depend on any of this, and must not.**  The
    shipped proxy is pure Python and links no C++; `nanopynix-testing`
    carries the bindings, built against one version of Nix.  This set builds
    the shell, and `nix/pynixd.nix` still builds the package.
