"""Record a real client against a real daemon, and compare two runs.

The other tests of `wirelog` build a recording from the codecs of this
package, so they cannot find a place where those codecs disagree with Nix.
This one puts a real `nix` client against a real `nix daemon` and reads what
passed between them.

It skips when there is no `nix` on the PATH, which is the case inside the
build sandbox that runs `checks.nix-daemon-protocol`. It runs in the dev
shell. Issue #175.
