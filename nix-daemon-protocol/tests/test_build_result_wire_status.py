"""Every `BuildResult` this package writes has a status a client can decode.

The wire carries the status as one byte, and a Nix client indexes a 15-entry
table with it -- `buildResultStatusTable`, `src/libstore/common-protocol.cc`.
An index at or above that size raises `Invalid BuildResult status ... from
remote`, and the client drops the connection. A build that merely failed then
reads to that client as a broken daemon.

This was found in the wild. A `nix copy` out of pynixd failed with

    error: Invalid BuildResult status f from remote

and `f` is not a number: the C++ format is `%d` against a `uint8_t`, which
boost renders as a character. ASCII 102 is `f`, and 102 is `UNKNOWN`.
