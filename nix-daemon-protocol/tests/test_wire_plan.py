"""The per-session wire plan: one resolved codec per (model, version, features).

A session negotiates one version and one feature set, then decodes thousands
of operations under them. The plan resolves every field's reader, writer and
default once for that shape, so the per-operation path is one cache lookup
and straight-line reads. These pin the sharing and the version boundary: a
plan that ignored the version would write 1.37 fields to a 1.36 peer.
