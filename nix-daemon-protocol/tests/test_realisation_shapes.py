"""The build trace has two wire shapes, and a feature name picks between them.

**Nix 2.34 carries a whole `Realisation` as one JSON string.** `realisation.py`
holds that shape, and every peer at the floor of this repository speaks it.

**The master branch carries a struct, and refuses the JSON.**
`WorkerProto::Serialise<UnkeyedRealisation>` at `worker-protocol.cc:485`
raises when the negotiated set does not hold `realisation-with-path-not-hash`,
and writes an output path and a set of signatures when it does.
`WorkerProto::Serialise<DrvOutput>` at `worker-protocol.cc:544` does the same
with a derivation path and an output name.

These tests pin the second shape, byte for byte. Nothing writes it yet:
`SUPPORTED_STANDARD_FEATURES` is empty, so pynixd never claims the feature and
never meets a peer that sends it. The codec lands first and the claim lands
after, because a claim with no codec drops the connection. Issue #162.
