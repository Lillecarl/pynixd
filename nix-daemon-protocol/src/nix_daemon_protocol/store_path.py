"""A Nix store path: one class, holding the base name.

**Nix holds the base name and nothing else.**
`src/libstore/include/nix/store/path.hh`:

    class StorePath
    {
        std::string baseName;

The store directory is not part of the value. It belongs to the store, at
`StoreDirConfig::storeDir`, and `printStorePath` is what puts it in front.

This module used to hold a second, different `StorePath`: a `WireScalar`, so
a `str`, holding the whole path -- while `pynixd.store_path` held the one
below. The two were not `==`, did not hash alike, and a dict keyed by one
never answered the other. Issue #3 holds the measurement. There is one class
now, and `pynixd.store_path` re-exports it.

**It is not a `str`.** Measured before the change: no call site depended on
the `str`-ness. Every str method called on a store path in the repository was
in `tests/functional`, and all of them were on `stdout.strip()` from a
subprocess. A `str` subclass also makes the wrong thing easy -- `path[:10]`
slices text that means nothing -- and it hides the question this class exists
to answer, which is which form a path is in.
