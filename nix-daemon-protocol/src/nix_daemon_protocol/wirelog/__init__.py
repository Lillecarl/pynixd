"""Record what a client and a Nix daemon say to each other, and compare two runs.

pynixd is a proxy, so its contract is that a client cannot tell it apart from
`nix-daemon`. That is a statement about the wire. This package tests it by
running one workload twice and comparing the two recordings:

    run A:  nix client -- recorder --> nix-daemon
    run B:  nix client -- recorder --> pynixd --> nix-daemon

A test of Nix that fails for its own reasons fails the same way in both runs,
so the two recordings agree and the comparison reports nothing. Only a
difference between the two is a finding, and the finding names one operation.
Issue #175.
