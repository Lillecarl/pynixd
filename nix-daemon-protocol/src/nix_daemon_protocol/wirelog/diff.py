"""Compare two recordings, and name the first operation that differs.

Run A puts a client against `nix-daemon`. Run B puts the same client against
pynixd, which puts it against the same `nix-daemon`. If pynixd keeps its
contract, the two recordings agree.

## What may differ, and why

pynixd is not a copy of `nix-daemon`, and each difference that is on purpose
is an entry of `EXEMPTIONS`. Each entry states its reason, and the report says
which entry it applied. A difference that no entry covers is a finding.

**The comparison reads the log messages as well as the answers.** A person
reads those lines, so a line that only one of the two wrote is a change even
when every byte of the answer agrees. Two kinds of line are exempt, and
`EXEMPTIONS` gives the reason for each: a line that pynixd writes about
itself, and the "removing stale temporary roots file" line, whose pid differs
between any two runs.

The comparison reads `STDERR_NEXT` alone. The activities -- `STDERR_START_ACTIVITY`,
`STDERR_RESULT` and the rest -- carry the progress bar of `nix build`, and the
decoder drops them. That is the gap that remains.

Issue #175.
