"""A passthrough that records what a client and a daemon say to each other.

The recorder listens on one Unix socket and connects to another. It copies
every byte both ways and writes each read to a file. It writes one file for
each connection, in the order the connections arrive.

    nix client ── recorder ──> nix-daemon

`NIX_DAEMON_SOCKET_PATH` puts it in the path of a test, so no client and no
daemon needs a change.

**This module decodes nothing, and it must keep that property.** A recorder
that reads the protocol can hold a defect of the codecs, and the recording
then measures the recorder. `tests/wirelog/test_recorder_is_dumb.py` states
the rule: this module imports `framing` from this package, and nothing else
of it. Issue #175.
