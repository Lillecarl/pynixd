"""Read a recording, and give the operations that it holds.

A recording is bytes. This module finds the handshake and each operation in
it, and it uses the codecs of this package to do that. A recording that it
cannot read is a finding: the file says what the daemon really sent, so the
fault is in the codecs, and `Session.problem` names the operation and the
offset.

## How the two directions divide into operations

The request stream divides exactly. Each request starts with the number of
its operation, and that number gives the type, and the type reads its own
fields. So the decoder knows where each request ends.

The response stream does not divide that way. To find the end of a response
the decoder would have to read the type of every response, and two of them
are not types at all: `NarFromPath` answers with a NAR, and the model of
`AddToStore` covers its header alone.

So the decoder divides the responses by **when the bytes arrived**, which the
recording states. The protocol is synchronous: a client does not send request
N+1 until it has read response N. Response N is therefore every byte the
daemon sent between the start of request N and the start of request N+1.

That rule also holds for the five operations that carry a framed source. The
daemon writes log messages while the client is still sending frames, and
those bytes fall inside the window of the operation that they belong to.

## What a response holds

Log messages come first, and then the payload. `logs.read_stream` reads the
log messages and stops after `STDERR_LAST`, or after an error. What remains
is the payload, and the decoder keeps it as bytes. A comparison of two
recordings compares those bytes, so a NAR and a `ValidPathInfo` both work and
neither needs a model.
