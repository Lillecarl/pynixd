        Only for values that are already the declared types: the daemon
        decoded them from the wire, parsed them from a store, or holds them
        as constants. There is nothing to coerce and nothing to refuse, so
        a full pydantic validation only re-checks what an earlier boundary
        already proved. Anything built from untrusted input -- a remote
        `.narinfo`, a client string -- goes through the validated
        constructor instead.

        The plan resolves at version 0 with no features, and only its
        defaults are kept: field defaults are static values, so no version
        resolves different ones, and the encode still gates fields under the
        negotiated version. This sets the body, fills those defaults, and
        gives the response fresh empty logs.

        The logs are fresh per response and not shared: `query_missing` and
        `set_options` append to the logs of the response they build, and a
        shared log would carry one operation's warnings into another's
        answer. The log is built by hand and not by `model_construct`: an
        empty log needs no validation, and `model_construct` cost half of
        this constructor.
