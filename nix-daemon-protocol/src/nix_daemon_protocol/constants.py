# **The version number stopped at 1.38, and each new capability is a
# feature.** `worker-protocol.hh:105` of Nix says so: "you generally shouldn't
# change the protocol version number. Define a new
# `WorkerProto::Version::Feature` instead." Nix 2.34, Nix 2.35 and the master
# branch all report 1.38, and they differ by the feature set alone.
#
# Both sides send a set of names, and the negotiated set is the intersection.
# A feature that one side does not name is off, however new that side is.

three belong to `WorkerProto::builderRpcV0`. Nix 2.34 offers none of the five.

**`builderRpcV0` is not recursive Nix.** It is the `builder-rpc-v0`
derivation feature of dynamic derivations, and it is a much smaller surface.
A derivation asks for it in `requiredSystemFeatures`, and Nix then gives the
builder a restricted daemon socket and **no output path in the environment**.
The builder registers each output itself, with `SubmitOutput` and
`AddToStoreScanning`. It cannot start a build through that socket, which is
the thing recursive Nix exists for. Every output of such a build is
content-addressed. `docs/notes/reentrancy.md` holds the detail, as Fact 9.

A name belongs here when the codec that the name gates is in this package,

codec that cannot read it drops the connection. Issue #162.

**This says what the codecs can do, and not what a proxy may claim.** pynixd
speaks to a backend as well as to a client, and it honours a feature only
when the backend reads the same shape. `DaemonProxy.honourable_features`
narrows this set to what every store that a build can go to offers, and the
handshake with the client uses that narrower answer.

`realisation-with-path-not-hash` covers `DrvOutput`, `UnkeyedRealisation`,
`BuildResult.builtOutputs`, `QueryRealisation` and `RegisterDrvOutput`. Each
one carries both shapes as two fields, and `needs_features` and
`unless_features` pick one.
