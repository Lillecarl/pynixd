      `nix/sources.nix` resolves the umbrella from UMBRELLA_REV when it is
      set. Without it that reference is unlocked, so every job takes the head
      of the default branch at the moment it starts. `umbrella land` pushes
      the working copies, which starts the run, and the umbrella lock commit
      follows seconds later, so a run that straddles the push reads two
      umbrellas. Measured in nixkube run 35026926963: seven seconds apart,
      two store paths, and a later job asking for one nothing had built.
      nanopynix issue #301.

      **It resolves the umbrella that locks this commit, not the head of the
      umbrella default branch.** The head is a moving answer: it is whatever
      landed most recently, which for a branch nobody landed is not related
      to this commit at all. `ci/walkback.sh` reads
      `refs/umbrella/pynixd/<revision>` from the umbrella remote instead,
      walking HEAD backwards to the nearest revision the umbrella has locked.
      One `git ls-remote` and one `git rev-list`, over the git protocol,
      which the api.github.com limit above does not count.

      Nix's own functional suite, against a plain daemon and against pynixd.

      **The verdict is the regression count, and not the failure count.** The
      runner builds the suite twice, once against `nix daemon` and once
      against pynixd, and `compare.py` names the tests that pynixd alone
      fails. A test that fails in both arms is a defect of Nix or of the
      harness, and it must not fail this job: `main:db-migration` is one, it
      wants an older Nix, and issue #45 holds it.

      `nanopynix-nixft-nix_2_34 all` already ends in that comparison and exits
      non-zero only on a regression, so the job is the program and its exit
      code.

      Measured at pynixd fc88ad6c on a 16-core machine: 3m25s at `JOBS=4` for
      both arms, 170 OK, 36 SKIP, 1 FAIL, 0 regressions. On a runner, in run
      35200463822: **5m07s for the whole job** -- 26 s to build the suite and
      4m30s for both arms. So the cap is a backstop against a hang and not a
      bound on the work, which is what a cap is for.

      `freeDiskSpace` is not needed for room here: the whole work directory
      came to 228 MB, of which 144 MB is the stores of the 205 tests, against
      the 14 GB a runner starts with. ghanix runs it anyway, because a job
      that builds Nix derivations never wants the runner's bundled
      toolchains.

      **`NIXFT_WORK` must be short, and outside `$HOME`.** A store under a
      long path gives a daemon socket over `sun_path`'s 108 bytes, and the
      failure then blames the daemon rather than the path. `$HOME` is mode
      700, and a sandboxed build runs as `nixbld1`, which cannot traverse it:
      seven tests that a plain daemon passes fail there, and a broken control
      arm hides a regression rather than reporting one.

      Issues #11 and #19.
