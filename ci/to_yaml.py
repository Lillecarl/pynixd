"""Render a workflow's JSON as YAML, with a literal block for every multi-line string.

**This is the third copy of this file.** nanopynix and nixkube hold the other
two. ghanix says rendering belongs to the caller because its two consumers
disagree about it, and they do -- about the gate and the formatter, not about
the writer. ghanix issue #3 holds the question of whether the writer should
move there.

`pkgs.formats.yaml` is remarshal, which writes a multi-line string as one
escaped double-quoted scalar. A `run:` body holding a ten-line shell script
then arrives as a single 600-column line with `\n` in it, which nobody reads
and no reviewer can diff.

PyYAML's resolvers are YAML 1.1's, which is what quotes the `on:` key. A
workflow needs that: to a 1.1 parser an unquoted `on` is the boolean `true`.
