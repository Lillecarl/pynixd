"""Gates and fixtures for the differential suite.

Three things have to be true before a differential test can say anything, and
each one is a skip rather than a failure:

1. The host is Linux. A chroot store cannot *build* anywhere else -- Nix says
   `building using a diverted store is not supported on this platform`. The
   whole design of this suite rests on two separated stores, so on darwin
   there is nothing to run. Use `vzrun` there.
2. nanopynix is installed. It is the oracle, and it is a dependency of this
   suite alone. `pynixd` itself does not depend on it and must not: the
   shipped proxy is pure Python and links no C++.
3. The case's experimental features are enabled in the linked Nix.

    A skip and a loud reason, like the other gates here: the suite genuinely
    cannot answer its question in that state, and a run that answers it with a
    stale wire package is worse than no run.

    `pynixd/` sits at the root of its checkout, so a
    `python -m pytest` from there imports it off the working copy through the
    current directory. `nix_daemon_protocol` sits two directories further down,
    at `nix-daemon-protocol/src/`, which is on no path by default -- so it
    resolves to whatever is installed in the environment instead.
