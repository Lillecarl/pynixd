"""The derivations that the differential suite builds twice.

Each case is one shape that a goal system has to get right. The value of the
suite is in this file: two engines agree trivially on a corpus that asks them
nothing.

Every derivation here is self-contained. It names no channel and no nixpkgs,
it builds with `/bin/sh`, and its script uses shell builtins only -- `echo` and
redirection. The Nix sandbox supplies `/bin/sh` and nothing else, so a script
that calls `cat` or `cp` fails for a reason that has no bearing on either goal
system.

A dependency is expressed by interpolating the dependency into the script.
That does two things at once, and both are wanted: it makes the dependency an
input derivation, so it must be built first, and it writes the path into the
output, so the output refers to it. The comparison reads both.
