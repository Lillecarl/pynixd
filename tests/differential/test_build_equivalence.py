"""Build each corpus case twice, and compare the two stores.

One run goes through `pynixd.goals`. The other goes through the goal system of
Nix, which nanopynix calls in process. The two runs use two separated chroot
stores, and the test compares what each build added to its own store.

Three rules shape the design.

**Instantiate identically, build differently.** Both arms get their `.drv`
from the same `nix-instantiate` invocation shape, against their own store.
Evaluation is deterministic, so the two `.drv` paths must agree, and the test
states that before it builds anything. It keeps the build as the only
difference between the arms.

**Compare the delta, not the store.** One arm is driven by a real
`nix-daemon` and the other by an in-process `LocalStore`. Each seeds its own
store in its own way, and neither way says anything about a goal system.
Comparing what the build *added* removes that from the question.

**Run the arms one at a time.** nanopynix reads both stores directly, and arm
A's store belongs to a running `nix-daemon` while the server is up. Every
direct read of that store happens before the server starts or after it stops.

    """A build that ran on a backend reaches a client, and matches Nix.

    This asks the fleet question where pynixd answers it, which is the wire and
    not the disk of the local store.

    An earlier version of this test read the local store directly and called a
    missing path a defect. It is not one. `DaemonProxy.store_for_output_path`
    looks a path up in `ctx.output_locations`, and `QueryValidPaths` reports a
    backend-resident output as valid on the strength of that. The local store
    holding nothing is the design: pynixd records where an output is and serves
    it from there, and `Scheduler._direct_import_localdb_outputs` is an
    optimisation for the one case where both stores are a `LocalDBStore`.

    So the builder here is a plain `LocalStore`, which is the path every
    backend that is not a local daemon takes, and the client is a real `nix`
    process copying out of pynixd over its Unix socket. What the client ends up
    with is compared against what Nix produced.

    Issue #160 has two layers, and the first one is fixed. `nix copy`
    realises its installables against the source store before it copies, so a
    store path installable arrives as an opaque derived path in a `BuildPaths`
    request -- and `DaemonProxy.execute` hands that to the goal engine before
    any of its mapping code runs. `EnsureDerivedPathGoal._ensure_opaque` asked
    the local store alone, so it failed every backend-resident path.

    The second layer is why path mapping alone could not fix it.
    `UDSRemoteStore::narFromPath` calls `Store::narFromPath`, which reads the
    store **directory** through `LocalFSStore::getFSAccessor`. A `unix://`
    client therefore never sends `NarFromPath`, and `NarFromPathHandler`
    cannot serve it a path that lives on a backend. `Scheduler._pull_outputs`
    puts the output in the local store, which is what this test proves.
