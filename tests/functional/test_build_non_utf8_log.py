"""A builder that prints non-UTF-8 bytes builds fine through pynixd.

`containerd-2.3.5` failed 4/4 with `pynixd: internal scheduler error` because
its log holds a raw gzip stream from the `gzipping man pages` fixup phase,
and the log stream decoded as strict UTF-8. The reference daemon forwards
those bytes raw (checked against `NIX_DAEMON_SOCKET_PATH=.../upstream`),
so this builds the issue's reproducer through the session server and
asserts the build succeeds and the bytes reach the client. Issue
Lillecarl/pynixd#62.

The client runs on raw subprocess pipes, and not on `run_subproc`: the
helper decodes strict UTF-8, so it would crash on the very bytes this test
is about.

NIX-DEFECT (#23): `nix log` serves the line back with `0x8b` replaced by
U+FFFD, although pynixd serves it raw. The client's build hook
(`build-remote`) logs over its fromHook pipe as JSON, and
`JSONLogger::write` in `src/libutil/logging.cc:254` dumps with
`error_handler_t::replace`, so the byte becomes U+FFFD there. The
client-side goal then writes that `resBuildLogLine` field into its own log
file (`src/libstore/build/derivation-building-goal.cc:675`), which is the
record `nix log` reads. pynixd cannot fix this from its side: the
corruption happens inside the client's own hook after pynixd's bytes
arrive, and pynixd's own record of the same line is raw (measured in the
guest against the session store's `.bz2`). Reported on the fork as
Lillecarl/nix#369. The FFFD assertion below is a
tripwire: it fails when the fork fixes its JSON logger, and then it should
assert the raw bytes. Issue Lillecarl/pynixd#63.
