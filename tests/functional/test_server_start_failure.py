"""
A failed start tears down what it started (issue #61).

`Server.start` acquires state before it finishes: the local store opens
pool connections and database handles, whose threads keep the
interpreter alive. When `start` raised after that point, nothing tore
them down, so the process survived its own traceback and systemd saw a
start timeout instead of the failure.

The test below fails `trust_policy` -- late enough that the store fully
started, the same shape as the original report -- and asserts the start
error propagates, the server reads as stopped, and no non-daemon thread
the start created is still alive.
