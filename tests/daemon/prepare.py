"""Both servers answer SSH, and each daemon socket is held by what it should be.

`ss` names the process listening on /nix/var/nix/daemon-socket/socket. On
`daemon` that must be pynixd, and on `control` it is systemd, which holds
nix-daemon's socket for activation. Without this, a `replace` mode that
quietly did nothing would pass every later phase: nix-daemon answers all
of them correctly on its own.
