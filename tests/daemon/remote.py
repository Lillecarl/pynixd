"""The client uses each server over OpenSSH, the two ways people do.

`--store ssh-ng://` builds in the far store. `--builders ssh-ng://` builds
there and copies the output back. On the far side `ssh-ng://` runs
`nix-daemon --stdio`, which talks to the daemon socket -- pynixd on
`daemon`, nix-daemon on `control`.
