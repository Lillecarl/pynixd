"""The Nix functional suite, both arms, inside the guest.

Runs the nixft harness's `all` (setup, control, pynixd, compare) off a work
directory on the guest's disk. The full log lands in `/artifacts/nixft.log`
-- thousands of lines, and the way back is a serial line -- and the verdict
line plus the compare summary are printed, so the run's outcome reads
without opening the log. Issue #45.
