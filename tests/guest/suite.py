"""One pytest suite, inside the guest. One script serves every suite phase.

Which suite is `vms.phase`, and `settings.suites` in
`tests/derivations/guest/default.nix` says what each one is. One process
per suite: `tests/unit` and `nix-daemon-protocol/tests` interfere, and one
process for both is how 57 failures once hid behind a green run of 684.
Issue #33.

The suite writes JUnit to `/artifacts/junit/`, and user-mode-nixos reads
it back when the phase ends, so every test is a case of this run -- in its
`junit.xml` and in `events.jsonl` -- and not only a line in a log.
