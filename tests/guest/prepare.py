"""Get every guest ready for its suite, and count what runs before it.

The suites run as `tester`, who does not own the store, so every `nix`

without it the failure is 21 errors in `test_drv_parser` reading
`creating directory "/nix/store/.links": Permission denied`, which names
a directory and not the daemon.
