"""Count the guest's processes again, and fail on one the suites left.

A guest and not a derivation, because these suites start nix daemons,
pynixd daemons, ssh servers and http servers, and build into stores they
make themselves. A build sandbox cleans up files and nothing else: a
process that outlives its test keeps running on the machine that ran it.
Measured while writing the first version of this: a UML guest leaked by
an earlier session had been using a whole core for thirty-one hours.

`always`, so it runs after a suite that failed -- a leak is most likely
exactly then.
