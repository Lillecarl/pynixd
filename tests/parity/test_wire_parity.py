"""The same workload against `nix-daemon` and against pynixd, byte for byte.

This is the stream mode of `nix/functional-tests/`, without the functional
tests. It runs one small workload twice, with the recorder of
`nix_daemon_protocol.wirelog` between the client and the daemon, and it states
that the two recordings agree.

    client -> outer.sock -> recorder -> inner.sock -> the daemon

The contract of pynixd is that a client cannot tell pynixd from `nix-daemon`,
and that is a statement about the bytes. A script of the functional suite says
"pass" or "fail" for reasons that are not the wire, and it needs Linux and a
builder. This needs neither, so it runs in the dev shell on any host.

It found three defects:

1. `nix store add-file` and then `nix store gc` deleted the file against
   `nix-daemon`, and deleted nothing against pynixd. An idle pooled connection
   kept a worker of the daemon alive, and that worker held the temporary root
   of the path. `tests/unit/test_gc_retires_idle_connections.py` holds the
   rule that corrects it.
2. `QueryPathInfo` answered `sha256:<digest>` where `nix-daemon` answers the
   digest alone. The fast path of pynixd read the `narHash` column of the
   database, which carries the name of the algorithm, and the wire does not.
   No client complained, because `Hash::parseAny` reads both forms.
3. The second build of a content-addressed derivation answered
   `willBuild: [cad.drv]` to `QueryMissing`, and `nix-daemon` answers an
   empty set. The client then took a different code path, so every operation
   after it differed too. `pynixd/goals/realisations.py` holds the rule.

There are two workloads, and each one is a run of the test.

**`builds`** builds four derivations, with `/bin/sh` as the builder: one plain
one twice, one with two outputs, one that fails, and one that is
content-addressed twice. A garbage collection follows each group. So
`BuildPathsWithResults`, the temporary roots that a build makes, a failure,
and the answer that a second build of the same derivation gives are all in
the comparison.

**`queries`** asks about one closure every way that `nix-store -q` asks, and
it exports the closure to a file and imports it again. `nix-store` is the old
command, and it reaches operations that `nix store` does not.

**`modes`** checks and repairs, signs a path, and copies a closure to a second
store and back. It found the fourth defect: `BuildMode.CHECK` and
`BuildMode.REPAIR` both raised `RuntimeError` in the goal system, so
`nix build --rebuild`, `--repair`, `nix-store --realise --check`,
`--repair-path` and `--verify --repair` all failed through pynixd.

**`impure`** builds one impure derivation three times. It found the fifth and
the sixth: pynixd read the realisation of the last build and answered with it,
where Nix builds an impure derivation every time; and
`hash_derivation_modulo` read the word `impure` in the digest of the output as
a content hash, so it called the derivation fixed-output and gave every
realisation an id that no Nix agrees with.
