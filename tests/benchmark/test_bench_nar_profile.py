"""CPU and memory profile of the server-side NAR forward path.

This drives `AddMultipleToStore._forward_stream`, the handler a client reaches
with `nix copy --to ssh-ng://...`. That is the path a nixkube node uses, and it
is the one that pegged a cluster at 999 millicores and 1850 MB.

`test_bench_nar.py` does not cover it. Every test there drives
`stream_paths_store_to_store`, which is pynixd acting as a *client* against
another store -- a different loop, with a different drain pattern.

Three shapes, because they fail differently. Many small paths put the cost in
per-path Python work, so read `cpu_ms_per_path`. Few large paths put it in the
byte loop, so read `peak_mib` against `sent_mib`: a streaming forward holds
roughly one chunk, and a buffering one holds the whole payload. One path of
many files varies what is *inside* a NAR, which the forward never parses -- it
measured about twice the per-byte cost of few-large, so it does not explain
nixkube#53's core-pegged-with-no-progress.

The metrics are reported, not asserted. Bounds belong here once the numbers are
known -- a guessed threshold either passes forever or fails on a slower runner.
What is asserted is that the copy succeeded and the paths arrived, so the
measurement is of a transfer that really happened.

`tracemalloc` inflates CPU somewhat, so compare `cpu_ms_per_mib` between shapes
in one run rather than against a production figure. `peak_mib` is the number
that carries the diagnosis and it is unaffected.

Every test here is also sampled by the autouse `profiler` fixture, which writes
`pyinstrument.txt` beside the test's log directory. That is where the attributed
hotspot is.

What it attributed, on the few-large shape, 128 MiB, 3.435s of CPU:

    3.073  AddMultipleToStoreHandler._forward_stream
    2.992    FramedReader.readexactly          <- 97% of the handler
    1.450      SSHNixReader.readexactly
    1.172      SSHNixReader.read_uint64        <- one 8-byte read per frame

**The cost is on the read side, not the write side.** `FramedReader.readexactly`
copies each byte three to four times: `_buf.extend(data)` into the accumulator,
then a slice and a `bytes()` out of it, then `_compact`'s `del _buf[:pos]`. Over
128 MiB that is about half a gigabyte of memcpy. `read_uint64` is the frame
length prefix, taken as its own socket read per frame.

Adding backpressure to the write loop moved `peak_over_sent` on few-large from
0.979 to 0.267 and left CPU unchanged at 3.07s, which is the same conclusion
from the other direction.

**`max_loop_lag_ms` is the number nixkube#37 and #53 turn on**, because a TCP
liveness probe is answered by the loop accepting a connection. `checkpoint()`
in the two transfer loops took the worst shape from 214.6 ms to 54.4 ms for no
measurable CPU.

What the residual 45-90 ms is *not*, both measured rather than reasoned:

    subprocess spawn   ~9 ms   (scratch probe, /bin/true on this loop)
    gc pause           ~2 ms   (`max_gc_pause_ms` below, all three shapes)

A gen-2 collection *can* stall this loop for 503 ms with two million live
objects, so the collector stays worth watching as allocation grows even though
it is not what these runs hit. The untested candidate for the floor is the SSH
handshake: every `nix copy` opens a connection and the key exchange is
CPU-bound crypto on this loop.

**Three ops, not one.** `nix copy --to ssh-ng://` is AddMultipleToStore (op
44) at protocol 1.32 and above, `remote-store.cc:508`. A single-path add is
AddToStoreNar (op 39) through `wire.forward_framed`,
`remote-store.cc:451`, and a pull is NarFromPath (op 38) through
`wire.forward_raw`. The three take different loops, and only op 44's was
measured before.

Op 39 reads Nix's 32 KiB `FramedSink` frames (`serialise.hh:71,724`), so it
did 32 times the per-turn work op 44 does at 1 MiB. A frame boundary carries
no meaning -- `FramedSource` reassembles the frames into one byte stream
(`serialise.hh:694`) -- so the forward gathers them into chunks. One 256 MiB
path, this machine:

    loop     state                    ms/MiB   peak_mib   wall_s
    asyncio  no drain, per frame        13.5       58.8     3.83
    asyncio  drain+checkpoint per frame 27.2*      n/a      n/a
    asyncio  coalesced to 1 MiB         10.0       22.1     2.96
    uvloop   no drain, per frame         8.6      206.9     2.69
    uvloop   drain+checkpoint per frame 12.7*      n/a      n/a
    uvloop   coalesced to 1 MiB          7.8       18.9     2.35

    * measured at 64 MiB, and never shipped: the drain landed and the
      coalescing landed on top of it.

**`peak_mib` is the finding, not `ms/MiB`.** uvloop held 206.9 MiB of a
256 MiB push, and the figure scales with the closure, so a multi-gigabyte
push is that many gigabytes resident. asyncio held less only because it was
slow enough for the daemon to keep up.

**`max_loop_lag_ms` did not move.** It read 14-22 ms before the fix and
14-45 ms after. One client cannot starve this loop: the whole client pipeline
-- NAR serialisation, hashing, syscalls, crypto -- costs about as much per MiB
as pynixd's forwarding does, so pynixd's reader waits on the socket anyway and
the loop gets scheduled regardless of whether the transfer yields.

Not the crypto specifically, which an earlier note here claimed. The cipher is
0.27 ms/MiB (`pynixd/constants.py`) against roughly 7 ms/MiB of Python, so it
is ~4% and cannot be the thing that paces this.

The starvation is real -- `tests/unit/test_forward_framed_stream.py` measures
0 turns of the loop for a whole payload -- but one client is the wrong shape to
find it in. `test_bench_nar_concurrency.py` is the right one.

**Both loops, because a throughput claim about pynixd is a claim about the
loop under it.** ./conftest.py parametrises `anyio_backend`, and `loop` in the
log line is the class that actually ran rather than the one asked for. One run:

    shape                loop      wall_s  srv_cpu  ms/MiB  max_lag_ms
    few-large            asyncio    5.247    3.014    23.5        97.9
    few-large            uvloop     3.142    1.821    14.2        54.0
    one-path-many-files  asyncio    2.620    1.184    37.9        50.6
    one-path-many-files  uvloop     1.747    0.698    22.3        45.4
    many-small           asyncio    2.857    1.559   124.7       144.7
    many-small           uvloop     1.961    1.215    97.2       328.2

uvloop is about 1.6-1.7x on CPU and wall, on every shape.

**Read `max_lag_ms` as a tail, not as a measurement.** The uvloop/many-small
cell above is 328.2 ms; the same cell measured 54.4 ms and 44.7 ms on the runs
either side of it. uvloop is not the slower loop for latency -- that one figure
is noise, and taking it at face value would have been a wrong conclusion drawn
from a real number. CPU and wall repeat to within a few percent across runs.

Take a median of several runs before concluding anything about a loop from the
tail.
