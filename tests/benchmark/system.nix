# A minimal NixOS container system, plus a pile of impure derivations.
#
# Two paths, and the system alone only exercises one of them. Evaluating
# nixpkgs asks the daemon about every derivation -- an IsValidPath and an
# AddTempRoot each -- and the realisation substitutes the closure. It does not
# *build* anything, because a minimal system is all in the store.
#
# So a thousand fresh derivations ride along, chained under one goal. Each
# reads `stamp`: a value the store cannot already hold, so the daemon must
# build it. The phase passes one value for both of its builds, so the goal is
# the same derivation twice. The first build is cold, the second is hot, and
# the second is the incremental cost of the front-end.
#
# The goal is its own derivation whose inputs are the system and the noise, so
# one `nix build` realises all of it rather than substituting a system whose
# closure is already in the store.
