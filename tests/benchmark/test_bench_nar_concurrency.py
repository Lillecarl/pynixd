"""What one client cannot show: the loop under N clients at once.

Every earlier measurement of a NAR transfer here used one client, and that is
why it concluded a push "does not starve the loop". With one client the whole
client pipeline -- NAR serialisation, hashing, syscalls, crypto -- costs about
as much per MiB as pynixd's forwarding does, so pynixd's reader waits on the
socket, the loop gets scheduled anyway, and lag stays near 20 ms whether the
transfer loop yields or not.

**A cluster never has one client.** Nodes pull closures while somebody pushes,
and nixlab2 reported `pynixd_event_loop_lag_max_seconds 7.912` against the
14-45 ms measured here. That gap is the thing this file exists to close.

The mechanism the single-client test cannot reach: with N transfers in
flight, the loop is never idle. A transfer that runs to completion without
suspending does not just delay a probe by its own duration -- it serializes
every other transfer behind it, so the stall a probe sees grows with N rather
than staying at one transfer's cost. The suspension is what interleaves them.

So `max_loop_lag_ms` against `clients` is the number to read, not
`cpu_ms_per_mib`. Measured on this machine, uvloop, 16 MiB per client:

    shape   clients=1   clients=4   clients=8
    push       3.6 ms     20.7 ms      73.3 ms
    pull       5.6 ms     34.0 ms     276.9 ms

**That 276.9 is a tail and not a measurement.** Three repeats of the same
cell gave 72.3, 100.7 and 59.2 ms. Take a median of several runs before
concluding anything, which is the same warning `test_bench_nar_profile.py`
carries and the same trap it fell into.

On medians, the per-chunk drain and checkpoint cost about 15% of lag and 5-10%
of throughput at this size (no-fix pull-8: 62.7, 55.6, 64.0 ms at 141 MiB/s;
with-fix: 72.3, 100.7, 59.2 ms at 121-141 MiB/s). **They are not a latency
optimisation at 16 MiB per client.** What they buy is a bounded transport
buffer and the guarantee that one large transfer cannot hold the loop, which
this size is too small to exercise -- a 16 MiB forward is about 100 ms of loop
time, so serialising eight of them is under a second either way.

Raise `_PER_CLIENT_KIB` to find the size where the guarantee starts paying.

**This still does not have what nixlab2 has.** Its store is on Ceph RBD, and
every store read there is a network round trip that a loopback test serves
from page cache. Treat a low figure here as "not reproduced", never as "does
not happen".
