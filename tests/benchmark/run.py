    op pump cannot see shows here.

    **The hot run is the number that matters, and the only one compared.**
    A cold build is mostly moving data: it fetches the closure and writes a
    thousand outputs. A hot build of the same goal has every path already, so
    what is left is the traffic the client sends to the daemon and the answer
    it reads back. That is the incremental cost of the front-end, and the only

    **The cold runs are warmup, and their times are not compared.** Both
    daemons front the same store, and both build the same minimal system from
    the same nixpkgs: all but a handful of hostname-specific paths are
    identical store paths. Whoever builds first fetches the shared closure,
    and whoever builds second reuses it. nix-daemon always runs first here,

    goals distinct so the hot builds are each daemon's own, but it cannot
    unshare the system closure that dominates the cold time.
