"""One client subscribes many times to one build, and the replay runs once.

A build is shared. A client asks for it as a root goal, and it asks for it
again as the input derivation of another goal. `QueuedBuild.add_subscriber`
replayed the whole log each time, so the client printed the error of one
build two or three times.

`build.sh:167` of the Nix functional suite counts the `error:` lines of
`nix build -f fod-failing.nix -j1 -L`. It expects one. Issue Lillecarl/nanopynix#196.
