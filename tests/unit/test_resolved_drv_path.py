"""The path that `BuildDerivation` names, after pynixd resolves the derivation.

**The daemon reads the derivation on the disk, and not the one the wire
carries.** `DerivationBuildingGoal::queryPartialDerivationOutputMap` at
`derivation-building-goal.cc:1239` takes the store copy whenever `drvPath` is
valid there, and the client put the original derivation in the store when it
instantiated it. A resolved derivation sent under the original path therefore
answered every question about its outputs from the unresolved one.

Nix writes the resolved derivation to the store and builds that path, at
`derivation-resolution-goal.cc`. These tests state that pynixd does the same.

**Nix does that for some derivations only, and `Derivation::shouldResolve` at
`derivations.cc:1129` names them.** An input-addressed output belongs to the
hash of the derivation that names it, so the resolved derivation needs a
different path for that output, and `checkDerivationOutputs` at
`derivations.cc:1324` refuses the one it has: "derivation has incorrect output
..., should be ...". So an input-addressed derivation keeps its own path, and
a derivation whose output is deferred, floating or fixed content-addressed
gets the resolved one.

pynixd stored the resolved form of every derivation that had an input, and the
daemon refused each input-addressed one. `main:gc` of the functional suite is
where that showed.

Issue #184.
