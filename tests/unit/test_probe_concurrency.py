"""The capability probe keeps its fan-out under a default `sshd`.

Each probe is a build, and over SSH each build takes a channel. `sshd`
permits ten sessions by default. The probe used to start every one of them
at once: three systems, then one build for each supported system by each
known feature. Two systems by nine features is eighteen, and eighteen at
once failed eight -- eighteen minus ten -- with
`OPEN_REQUEST_SESSION_FAILED`. Issue #15.

The probes here never reach a socket. They count themselves instead, which
is what the bound is about; whether a build answers is a different question
and the functional suite asks it.
