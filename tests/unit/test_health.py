"""`/healthz` has to answer two questions a TCP probe cannot.

A kubelet `tcpSocket` probe calls `connect()`, and the kernel completes it from
the listen backlog whether or not the application ever accepts. So it passes
against a wedged process, and fails only when a stall outlasts its timeout --
which a busy process also does. nixkube#37 and #53.

These test the verdict, not the endpoint: the report is what decides the status
code, and it is where the logic is.
