"""A handler that changes the store gives the connection the client's options.

`LocalStore::addToStore` of Nix checks the signature of each path against
`trusted-public-keys`, and a daemon learns that setting through `SetOptions`
alone. The three handlers that add a path took a transfer connection with no
options, so the daemon read its own keys and refused a path the cache had
signed with the key the client had just named. `require-sigs` and
`secret-key-files` travel the same road.

`ca:signatures` of the Nix functional suite measured it. This test is the
machine-checkable half: prose said "a connection carries the options of one
client" from issue #192 onward, and three call sites did not. Issues #197 and
#192.
