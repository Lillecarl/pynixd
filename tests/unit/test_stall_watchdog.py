"""The watchdog that catches a stall in the act.

A push on nixlab2 sat at 100% CPU for about ten minutes with no progress, then
resumed. Nothing recorded what it was doing: a probe restarts the container,
the restart clears the lifetime-max gauge, and no benchmark here has ever
reproduced it. The transfer fixes cannot be the cause either, because only
42.9 MiB moved in total -- the cost is not proportional to the bytes.

So the evidence has to be taken from inside the process while it is stuck.
The last test is the one that matters: it stalls a real event loop with a
real CPU-bound Python loop and asserts a dump came out. Everything the
watchdog claims rests on the GIL being released during that stall, and only
running it proves that.
