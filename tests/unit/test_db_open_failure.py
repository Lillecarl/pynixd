"""A failed open leaves no threads behind.

`LocalStoreDB.open` probes the database with a pooled connection, and
each pooled connection holds a worker thread. When the probe failed,
`open` returned an inactive instance with the pool still open: the
threads outlived the call, and a short-lived process with no other work
-- a CLI whose store database is unreadable -- never exited. The same
class of failure as issue #61 one level up, found by the freshness
simulation tripping over it.
