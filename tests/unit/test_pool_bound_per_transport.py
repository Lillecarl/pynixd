"""How wide a store's pool may go depends on what a connection costs.

A connection to a Unix-socket daemon costs a process here and nothing on
anyone else's machine. A connection of `SSHSubprocessStore` is
`create_process`, which is an SSH **session** channel, and `sshd` permits
ten of those for each network connection. `sshd` does not queue the extra
ones; it refuses them, and `_send_probe` does not catch that refusal.

`SSHSocketStore` is the case that looks the same and is not.
`open_unix_connection` is a forwarded channel, and `sshd_config(5)` says
`MaxSessions` at 0 "will prevent all shell, login and subsystem sessions
while still permitting forwarding". Issue #43.
