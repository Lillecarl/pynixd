"""`/metrics` answers, and it is routed only when it is asked for.

pynixd has served Prometheus metrics since `metrics.py` was written, and no
deployment could reach them: the HTTP server starts only when `http_port` is
set, and that defaults to null on both platform modules.
`services.pynixd.metrics.enable` sets it, and these state what that reaches.

The route matters as much as the body. `enable_metrics` decides whether
`/metrics` is registered at all, and `metrics_no_auth` decides whether the
authentication middleware lets it past -- a metrics port that answers 401 to
a scraper is the same as no metrics port.
