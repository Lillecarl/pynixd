"""An opaque path a backend holds is a path pynixd can produce.

A fleet build leaves its outputs on the backend that ran it. `Scheduler.
_collect_outputs` records where each one went in `ctx.output_locations`, and
`DaemonProxy` and `NarFromPathHandler` both read a path from the backend that
holds it. `EnsureDerivedPathGoal` asked the local store alone, so the build
succeeded and the very next request for its outputs failed with `opaque path
is not valid locally` -- issue #160.

`nix copy` asks this way. It realises its installables against the source
store before it copies anything, and a store path installable is an opaque
derived path.
