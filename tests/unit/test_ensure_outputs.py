"""The derivation on the wire keeps every output, and the answer keeps one.

`BuildDerivation` carries no set of wanted outputs. The daemon builds each
output that the derivation names, and it rewrites `builtins.placeholder <name>`
for each of those names, at `derivation-builder.cc:802` of Nix.

`EnsureDerivedPathGoal` removed each output that the derived path does not
name, so `drv^out` sent a derivation of one output. The builder then read
`${placeholder "bin"}` as a path, and no file is there. `main:placeholders` of
the functional suite is that build. Issue #178.

The removal also split one build in two: the derivation is the dedup key of a
`BuildDerivationGoal`, so `drv^out` and `drv^bin` made two derivations and two
builds of the same work.

The answer is the other half. Nix removes each unwanted output from
`builtOutputs`, at `derivation-goal.cc:291`, so a client that asks for one
output reads one output.
