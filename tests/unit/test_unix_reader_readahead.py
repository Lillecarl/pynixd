"""`UnixNixReader` reads ahead. Prove it never strands a byte.

The reader buffers, because `StreamReader.readexactly` is one await per call
and the protocol makes three of them for every string: the length, the
payload, and its padding. One larger read serves many small ones from memory.
That is also the way it could corrupt a connection: bytes held in this buffer
belong to whatever reads next on the same connection.

These drive `UnixNixReader` over a real `asyncio.StreamReader`, fed in small
pieces, because the property is about the reader's own bookkeeping and not
about the socket.
