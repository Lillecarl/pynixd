"""A living temporary-roots owner for fixtures.

An unlocked temp file is a stale file by Nix's own definition: `findTempRoots`
unlinks whatever it can lock (`gc.cc:193`). A fixture that writes a temp file
and closes it stages a dead owner, and the mirror under test reaps it. This
helper writes the file and parks a subprocess on its write lock -- the shape
of `createTempRootsFile` (`gc.cc:62-65`) -- so the walk under test sees a
living owner. Same-process locks never conflict, so a thread or an open file
in the test process would not do.
