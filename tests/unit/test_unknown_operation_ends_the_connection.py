"""An operation that pynixd does not know ends the connection.

Nothing reads the arguments of an unknown operation, so a loop that continues
reads the first argument as the next operation number. `nix-daemon` closes the
connection instead: `performOp` throws `invalid operation` at
`daemon.cc:1107`, before `logger->startWork()`, so `errorAllowed` at
`daemon.cc:1218` is false and the outer catch at `daemon.cc:1232` returns.

    **A new operation of Nix comes with a feature name, and not with a new
    protocol number.** `worker-protocol.hh:105` states that rule, and 1.38 is
    the number that Nix 2.34, Nix 2.35 and the master branch all report. The

    Both of those two belong to `builder-rpc-v0`, which is a derivation
    feature of dynamic derivations. Nix gives such a builder a restricted
    daemon socket and no output path in the environment, and the builder
    registers each output itself. It is not recursive Nix: the builder starts
    no build through that socket. `docs/notes/reentrancy.md` holds the
