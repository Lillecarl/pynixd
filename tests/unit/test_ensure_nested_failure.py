"""What a client reads when the producer of a dynamic derivation fails.

`builtins.outputOf failingProducer.outPath "out"` gives a nested derived path.
The goal that makes the derivation fails, so no derivation arrives, and the
goal of the nested path has nothing to build.

`DerivationTrampolineGoal` at `derivation-trampoline-goal.cc:107` of Nix
answers "failed to obtain derivation of '<outer>'". pynixd answered
`pynixd: nested derived path did not produce out: <path>!out!out`, which names
an internal state and prints the separator that Nix does not print.

`dyn-drv/failing-outer.sh:48` reads the sentence of Nix. Refs #175.
