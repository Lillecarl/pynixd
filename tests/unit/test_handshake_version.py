"""pynixd reports the version of the daemon behind it, not its own name.

`store-info.sh:69` of the Nix functional suite runs `nix store info` and
greps the output for `Version: <the daemon's version>`, taking that version
from `nix daemon --version`. pynixd answered `pynixd-0.1.0`, and that was
the **one** test of the 207 that failed against pynixd and passed against
`nix-daemon`.

The field is not a name. `isDaemonNewer` in `common/functions.sh:138-142`
feeds it to `builtins.compareVersions`, and so does any client deciding what
the daemon supports. A name there answers rubbish and nothing says so.
