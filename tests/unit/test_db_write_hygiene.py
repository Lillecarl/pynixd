"""Failed checkouts return clean, and flushes pop only flushed seeds.

On 2026-10-06 every pynixd write to the store database failed for
four hours with `database is locked` while fresh connections wrote
fine: pooled connections carry their state across checkouts, and a
checkout that failed mid-write held the file lock until restart.
`acquire_conn` now rolls back on checkin; the first test pins that.

The flush used to drain its queues up front and merge seeds back on
failure — any exit that skipped the merge (cancellation above all)
lost references silently. It now snapshots the queues and subtracts
only committed work, one transaction per chunk; the other tests pin
both halves.
