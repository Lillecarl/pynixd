"""A build whose outputs did not arrive is not a build that succeeded.

`execute_build` completed the build and then pulled the outputs, catching a
pull failure and writing it to the server's log. The client already held a
successful `BuildResult` by then. It went on to ask the local store for a
path that is not there, and the error it got named the missing path rather
than the copy that failed. Issue #12.

The ordering was never a race: `_collect_outputs` is awaited in the same
coroutine, so `execute_build` did not return until it finished. The
swallowed failure is the defect.
