"""pynixd records when each store path was last referenced.

The user's design: `registrationTime` is an otherwise unused column, so
refreshing it on every reference turns stock `nix-collect-garbage
--delete-older-than` into an LRU collector for free.

None of it ran. `mark_path` and `mark_paths` had no caller in any project of
this repository, so `pending_references` was always empty,
`flush_references` returned at its first line, and the background task woke
every five seconds to do nothing at all. `LocalDBStore.execute` is the caller
that was missing.

`PynixdPathAccess` is the second half. `registrationTime` says "when this
path entered the store", and `nix path-info --json` reports it as that, so
one number cannot answer both questions afterwards. Issue Lillecarl/nanopynix#166.
`registrationTime` is therefore read, never written, and the flush touches
marked heads only: no closure expansion, no 100k-row write transactions
against the daemon's own database.
