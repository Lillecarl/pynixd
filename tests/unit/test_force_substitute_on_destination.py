"""The deployment can force substitute-on-destination. Issue #54.

`nix copy --substitute-on-destination` is a client flag, and
`nix-copy-ssh-common.sh:69-70` of the Nix functional suite asserts what it
buys: a copy from a store that lacks the path fetches it from the
destination's substituter instead of failing. A client that forgets the
flag sends the whole closure over the link even when the destination sits
next to a cache that holds every path, so the deployment takes the choice
over with `force_substitute_on_destination`: every client op 31 that did
not set the flag is forwarded with it set, and the upstream daemon runs
`substitutePaths` ahead of `queryValidPaths` (`daemon.cc:377`).

Two halves make that complete. The proxy rewrites the flag, and the
SQLite fast path yields on it: SQLite holds no substituter, so answering
from it would call a substitutable path invalid, with or without the
setting.
