"""The collector blends size and age by disk pressure, and pressure bounds the pass.

`_by_weight` and `_take_until_below_target` are pure on purpose: the order
a pass deletes in, and where a bounded pass stops, are asserted here,
without a daemon, a store, or a disk. What they order -- sizes from the
path infos, ages from the access table -- is read elsewhere; these two
only decide.
