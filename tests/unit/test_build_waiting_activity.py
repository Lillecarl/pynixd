"""A client that joins somebody else's build is told that is what it is doing.

Nix opens an `actBuildWaiting` activity at `lvlWarn` when it cannot take the
output locks of a derivation, and polls until they are free:
`src/libstore/build/derivation-building-goal.cc:421-426`. The message names
the lock files.

pynixd does not lock; it dedupes. `BuildQueue.enqueue` keys `_by_path` on the
derivation path and hands the second caller the first caller's future, and
`QueuedBuild.add_subscriber` replays the first builder's log to it. So the
second client read the output of a build it did not start, with no line
saying why. Issue #25.

This stands for `build.sh:167` of the Nix functional suite, which counts the
`error:` lines of `nix build -f fod-failing.nix -j1 -L` and expects one. The
activity added here carries no `error:` line, and the count has to stay one.
