"""Every NAR loop counts its own bytes, so a transfer is never invisible.

Before these series only AddMultipleToStore (op 44) was counted. A pod could
receive a closure one path at a time, or serve one to every node that started,
and `pynixd_nar_forward_bytes_total` stayed flat throughout.

That also makes the split the discriminator. Given a push whose op nobody
recorded, whichever receive counter moved names the loop it took -- which is
the question nixkube#58 turns on.

The counters live on the handlers, not in `pynixd.wire`, because the op is
known at the handler. These tests therefore drive the wire helpers with the
same `on_bytes` the handlers pass, which is what the handlers can be wrong
about: a helper that never calls it leaves the series flat with no failure
anywhere.
