"""A store Nix has diverted builds in a chroot, or it builds into the wrong store.

nix 2.34.8 `derivation-builder.cc:2111` forces the sandbox on when
`storeDir != realStoreDir`. Twelve lines later, at `:2120`, a system without
mount and PID namespaces turns it off again, with `debug()` and with
`sandbox-fallback` at its default of true. The builder then writes to
`/nix/store/<hash>-<name>`, which belongs to the machine, while Nix looks for
the output under the real directory of the diverted store.

A GitHub runner blocks unprivileged user namespaces, so the capability probe
answered `failed to produce output path` for `echo x86_64-linux > $out` there
and nowhere else. `builder`'s feature matrix emptied, and 39 tests failed with
`No compatible store for x86_64-linux` in CI run 35194109526. Issue #47.
