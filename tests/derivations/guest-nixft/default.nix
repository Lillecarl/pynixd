# The Nix functional suite (nixft), in a UML guest.
#
# Both arms (control + pynixd) run inside the guest off a work directory on
# the guest's disk, so nothing of the run touches the host but the guest's
# sparse disk and memory files, which the poweroff removes. The guest sees
# the host's store as a local-overlay lower layer (`hostStore`), so every
# input the suite builds against resolves locally and no fetch crosses the
# uplink; the per-test stores land in the upper layer and die with the
# guest. Issue #45.
#
# UML by direction: the suite is daemons and builds, not clocks, and UML
# needs no KVM. The backend is hardcoded, not a knob: this spec exists for
# one run shape.
