# The performance benchmarks, in a guest.
#
# One ordinary NixOS machine running pynixd as its daemon (`replace` mode, as
# `tests/switch` does), so the stock nix-daemon sits behind it on
# `daemon-socket/upstream`. A client reaches either with `NIX_REMOTE`, and the
# two front the same store, which is what the C++ comparison wants: the same
# work, one daemon against the other.
#
# Not a gate: a benchmark prints numbers and passes unless the run fails.
# `nix run --file . tests.benchmark.driver -- --out <abs>`.
