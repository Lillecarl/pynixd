"""Measure what a liveness probe experiences: time the loop ran nothing.

A TCP probe is answered by the loop accepting a connection, and `/healthz` by
the loop running a handler. Either way, a stretch of work that does not
suspend answers neither -- so the probe fails against a process that is busy
rather than wedged, and the restart destroys the evidence (nixkube#37, #53).

`await` alone does not suspend. A coroutine that returns from a buffer
finishes without reaching the loop, and asyncio's `drain` returns straight
away below the high-water mark, so a read-and-write loop can run to the end of
a payload while every line of it looks like it awaits.

This mirrors `pynixd.health.LoopLagMonitor`, which is the production measure
of the same thing. It is separate so that a test measures the loop it runs on
rather than asserting against the process's own monitor.
