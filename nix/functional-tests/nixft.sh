#
# **The builder is disposable, and a run must not care.** It shuts down after
# 60 seconds with no open connection, and the next boot makes its disk again
# from nothing. No directory of it survives that, `$HOME` included: `$HOME`
# and `/scratch` are two paths on one ext4 image that the host truncates on
# every cold boot.
#
# Two rules follow, and this script is both of them:
#
# - **One invocation does the whole job.** A host script that built, then
#   prepared, then ran, left a half-made work directory whenever a restart
#   landed between two of those calls, and the next call reported something
#   else. `nixft-remote.sh` re-establishes everything it needs instead.
# - **One invocation holds one connection.** The shutdown counts open
#   connections, so a suite that runs inside a single invocation keeps the
#   builder alive for its whole length and cannot lose its work directory
#   halfway.
#
# **A dead worker and a failed test are not the same answer.**
# `nixft-remote.sh` writes `NIXFT-DONE <code>` as its last line and always
# exits 0, so the exit code of the transport says one thing only: whether the
# command reached the end. A run with no such line is retried; a run with one
# is the answer, and this exits with the code that line names.
#
# Options:
#   --work DIR    the work directory in the builder. Default: the builder
#                 chooses `/scratch/nixft`. Keep it outside `$HOME`: seven
#                 tests that a plain `nix-daemon` passes fail under `$HOME`,
#                 which breaks the control run. `nixft-remote.sh` holds the
#                 measurement.
#   --tries N     attempts before giving up. Default 3.
#   --repo DIR    the checkout to test. Default: the one that holds this file.
#   --log-level L the log level of pynixd, for example `DEBUG`. Default
#                 `WARNING`, which is what the daemon uses. Several answers
#                 about the scheduler are `log.debug` lines, so a question
#                 about which road a build took needs `DEBUG`.
#   --dump PATH   write this file of the builder to the terminal after the
#                 command. Give the option again for a second file. A path
#                 with no leading `/` is relative to the work directory.
#   --nix-version V
#                 the attribute of `nixFunctionalTests` to run, such as
#                 `nix_2_34` (the default), `nix_2_35` or `git`. 2.34 is the
#                 floor of this repository, so the default measures the floor.
#                 2.35 offers the protocol features that 2.34 does not, so it
#                 is the only arm that can see the gap of issue #162. Give a
#                 separate `--work` for each version: the work directory holds
#                 the checked-out test scripts of one Nix, and `setup` runs
#                 only when the build directory is absent.
#
# **`--dump` is how a debug line of pynixd reaches this host.**
# `meson test --print-errorlogs` prints the tail of the log of a failed test
# and not the whole of it, so a `log.debug` line that a request writes at its
# start does not survive to the terminal. The whole log is at
# `build/meson-logs/testlog.txt` in the builder, and no directory of the
# builder survives the run, so the file has to leave in the same invocation:
#
#   ./nixft.sh --log-level DEBUG --dump build/meson-logs/testlog.txt pynixd build
set -euo pipefail
