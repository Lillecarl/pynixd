"""Read what each test left in its store, and compare two runs of that.

The stream mode compares the bytes on the wire. This compares the result. A
daemon can answer every request with the same bytes and still register a path
with the wrong references, and a daemon can answer differently and leave an
identical store. The two measures are independent, and a defect shows in one
or the other.

    snapshot TEST_ROOT_DIR OUT.json   read every test store under a run
    compare CONTROL.json CANDIDATE.json

The reader is `sqlite3` against `$TEST_ROOT/var/nix/db/db.sqlite`, opened read
only. Three reasons for the database rather than a client:

1. The stores are dead when this runs. `run.sh` stops each daemon with the
   test, so a client would have to start 200 more daemons to ask them.
2. The database is under both engines. A defect in a reader that sits above
   them could hide a difference; this sits below.
3. pynixd adds its own tables to the same file, and this reads none of them.
   `PynixdSchema`, `PynixdDerivationStats` and `PynixdPathAccess` are the work
   of the proxy and say nothing about the store.

`tests/differential/snapshot.py` states why `registrationTime` and `sigs` are
dropped, and this drops them for the same two reasons: the first is a wall
clock, and the second names the key of the store that signed.

#
# Measured, and not guessed: two runs of the same arm over the `ca` suite of

#
# Four of these five hold an `-env` derivation, and one variable is why.
# `NIX_BUILD_TOP` is `.../var/nix/builds/nix-<pid>-<random>`, so it is a new
# string in every run. It reaches the output because a `-env` derivation is a
# dump of the build environment, and the store path does not move with it: the
# derivation is input-addressed, so the same derivation keeps the same name and
# answers a new NAR hash. The lengths differ too, which is the `nar_size` delta
