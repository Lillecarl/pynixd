#   WORK                 the working directory of setup.sh. Default /scratch/nixft.
#   JOBS                 tests at a time. Default 1.
#   NIX_DAEMON_PACKAGE   the package whose `bin/nix daemon` serves the tests.
#                        Default: the Nix on PATH. Give the pynixd shim here to
#                        test pynixd.
#
# Each argument goes to `meson test`, so `run.sh --suite ca` runs one suite.
