# Build a package for the `NIX_DAEMON_PACKAGE` place that records the wire.
#
# It wraps another such package. `bin/nix daemon` of this one starts the
# recorder, and the recorder starts `bin/nix daemon` of the inner package. So
# the same shim records a plain Nix daemon and pynixd, and the two runs differ
# in the inner package alone. That is the whole point: a difference in the two
# recordings is a difference in the two daemons, and not in the harness.
#
#   client -> $NIX_DAEMON_SOCKET_PATH -> recorder -> iSocket -> inner daemon
#
# The recorder gives the inner daemon `NIX_DAEMON_SOCKET_PATH=iSocket`, so the
# inner package needs no change and does not know that it is inner.
#
# Inputs:
#   WORK        the working directory of setup.sh. Default /scratch/nixft.
#   INNER       the package whose `bin/nix daemon` answers. Required.
#   REAL_NIX    the nix program, for every command that is not `daemon`.
#   OUT_ROOT    the directory for the recordings. Required.
#   PYTHON      a python that can import nix_daemon_protocol. Required.
#   SHIM_DIR    where to write this shim. Default $WORK/record-shim.
#
# It prints the path of the package, for `NIX_DAEMON_PACKAGE`.
