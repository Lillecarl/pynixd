# Everything the functional suite needs, in one run inside the Linux builder.
#
# **The builder is disposable, and this script takes that as the rule.** The
# worker lives about 60 seconds and a restart wipes the writable layer of its
# store, so nothing here may depend on a step of an earlier invocation. Each
# run seeds the fetch cache, builds the runner, prepares the work directory
# and runs the command, and each of those four steps is a no-op when its
# result is already there.
#
# `nixft.sh` on the host starts this script. Do not call it directly: it reads
# its arguments in a fixed order and states no defaults.
#
# Arguments, in this order:
#   SRC          the source store path of the checkout to test
#   WORK         the work directory of the suite, or `-` for the default
#   GIT_CACHE    a store path that holds `tarball-cache-v2`, or `-`
#   FETCH_CACHE  a store path that holds `fetcher-cache-v4.sqlite`, or `-`
#   LOG_LEVEL    the log level of pynixd, or `-` for the default
#   ...          the arguments of the runner, for example `pynixd --suite ca`
#
# The last line it writes is `NIXFT-DONE <code>`. The host reads that line to
# tell a test failure from a dead worker: a run with no such line did not
# finish, whatever exit code the transport gave.

# ── The work directory ──────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Two properties, and Nix states the reason for each one itself.
#
# **No parent of it is a symbolic link.** Nix refuses such a store: "the path
# ... is a symlink; this is not allowed for the Nix store and its parent
# directories". `/tmp` on darwin is that case, and it is why the suite cannot
# run on the host.
#
# **The path is short.** Each test puts a daemon socket at
# `<work>/tmp/nix-test/<suite>/<test>/dSocket`, and `sun_path` holds 108
# bytes. A long work directory therefore fails inside a test, and the failure
# it gives says only that a socket did not appear.
#
# **The work directory goes outside `$HOME`, and that is measured.** One run
# of `all --suite ca` under `$HOME/nixft-ca` and one under `/scratch/nixft-ca`,
# same checkout and same suite:
#
# | work directory   | regressions | fails in the control as well |
# | ---------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------- |
# | `$HOME/nixft-ca` | 2           | 8                            |
# | `/scratch/nixft-ca` | 4        | 1                            |
#
# Seven tests that a plain `nix-daemon` passes fail when the work directory
# sits under `$HOME`: `build`, `build-cache`, `nix-copy`, `nix-shell`, `repl`,
# `selfref-gc` and `signatures`. Each one builds something.
#
# **A build user cannot reach `$HOME`.** The two directories of the builder
# carry these modes:
#
#     drwx------ builder builder  /nix/.rw-store/home
#     drwxrwxrwt root    root     /nix/.rw-store/scratch
#
# A sandboxed build runs as `nixbld1`, which is `uid=30001 gid=30000(nixbld)`.
# That user is not `builder`, it is not in the group of `builder`, and mode
# 700 gives "other" no execute bit, so it cannot traverse into `$HOME` at all.
# `/scratch` is 1777, which every user may traverse.
#
# The permissions and the identity above are measured. The step from them to
# these seven failures is an inference, and a strong one: each failing test
# builds, each passing one does not, and a sandbox that cannot enter its own
# directory fails without a message that names the reason.
#
# The consequence is what makes the default worth stating. The control run is
# the measuring instrument of this suite, and a broken control hides a
# regression rather than reports one: two of the four real regressions read as
# "fails in both" in that run.
#
# **No directory of the builder survives a restart of it, `$HOME` included.**
# `$HOME` and `/scratch` are two paths on one ext4 image, and `runVm` of the
# host makes that image again on every cold boot. The host shares `/host-nix`
# and `/var/keys`, and both are read-only, so there is no writable path of the
# host to fall back to either. So the choice between the two names buys no
# durability, and the measurement above is the whole reason for it.
#
# The property that does hold is narrower, and the design above rests on it:
# the builder shuts down after 60 seconds with **no open connection**. One
# invocation holds one connection for its whole life, so a suite that runs
# inside a single invocation cannot lose its work directory halfway.
