# --- Patch 1: the daemon must not inherit NIX_REMOTE=daemon ---------------
#
# `startDaemon` sets NIX_REMOTE=daemon after it starts the daemon, so upstream
# always starts a daemon with an empty value. This mode exports NIX_REMOTE
# before the first test, so the daemon inherited `daemon`, and it opened
# itself as its own store. Each worker then became a client of the daemon, and
# that client forked another worker. The argv of a worker holds the process id
# of its client, and those ids were other workers:
#
#     81490  81448  Ssl  nix 81488      <- 81488 is a worker
#     81492  81448  Ssl  nix 81490      <- 81490 is a worker
#
# One test made 16,451 processes in under two minutes, and the machine went
# into swap.

# --- Patch 2: give the daemon the store again after a wipe ----------------
#
# `doClearStore` runs `rm -rf "$NIX_STATE_DIR"`, and the database of the store
# is in that directory. The daemon holds that database open. 60 of the 203
# scripts call `clearStore`. `restartDaemon` returns at once when no daemon
# runs, so the plain `NIX_REMOTE=''` mode does not change.

    # Added for the daemon run. The lines above deleted the database that the
    # daemon holds open. Give it the new store.

# --- Patch 3: initialise the database against the local store -------------
#
# `nix-store --init` runs before any daemon, so no socket exists yet, and
# NIX_REMOTE already says `daemon`.

# --- Patch 4: start a daemon for every test -------------------------------
#
# Only 19 of the 203 scripts call `startDaemon` themselves. Those 19 keep
# working: `startDaemon` returns at once when a daemon already runs, and
# `restartDaemon` kills the daemon and starts it again.
# `$NIX_STATE_DIR` is a part of the pattern that grep reads, and not a name to
# expand here.
